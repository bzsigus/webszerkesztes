I'm Joanne, that's Adam behind the camera, and we are the couple from inspiredtaste.net, and today we are making our ultimate cheese lasagna. It has not one, but five cheeses. It is so good, and what I really love about the recipe is you can get all of the assembly done in under 20 minutes. 

It's so quick and easy, you're gonna love it. Let's go make it! Start by making the creamy cheese layer. I've got 8 ounces of ricotta, 8 ounces of mascarpone, one cup of grated parmesan, an egg, and a quarter teaspoon each of salt and pepper.

The mascarpone is the secret to making an unbelievably creamy cheese lasagna. We also need to prep some mozzarella and fontina cheese. I shred the mozzarella, and because the fontina I buy is usually thin, I slice it. 

Let's assemble! Spread one cup of your favorite red sauce over the bottom of a large baking dish. Line up 3-4 lasagna noodles, no baked noodles make things easy. Spread over half of the ricotta mixture, add basil leaves, and then put down a second layer of noodles. 

Add another cup of sauce and cover with half of the mozzarella and fontina cheese. Add a third layer of noodles, spread over the rest of the ricotta mixture, then scatter more basil leaves on top. Add a fourth layer of noodles, spread one more cup of sauce on top, and finish with the remaining mozzarella and fontina cheeses.

Bake the lasagna uncovered until the cheese bubbles and the noodles cook about 30 minutes. And that's it! Outrageously cheesy cheese lasagna that's surprisingly easy to make. We hope you try it! Thanks for watching.
