<p lang="en">(0:00) I'm Joanne, that's Adam behind the camera, and we are the couple from inspiredtaste.net,</p>
<p lang="en">(0:05) and today we are making our ultimate cheese lasagna. It has not one, but five cheeses.</p>
<p lang="en">(0:10) It is so good, and what I really love about the recipe is you can get all of the assembly done</p>
<p lang="en">(0:16) in under 20 minutes. It's so quick and easy, you're gonna love it. Let's go make it!</p>
<p lang="en">(0:22) Start by making the creamy cheese layer. I've got 8 ounces of ricotta, 8 ounces of mascarpone,</p>
<p lang="en">(0:27) one cup of grated parmesan, an egg, and a quarter teaspoon each of salt and pepper.</p>
<p lang="en">(0:33) The mascarpone is the secret to making an unbelievably creamy cheese lasagna.</p>
<p lang="en">(0:38) We also need to prep some mozzarella and fontina cheese. I shred the mozzarella,</p>
<p lang="en">(0:42) and because the fontina I buy is usually thin, I slice it. Let's assemble! Spread one cup of</p>
<p lang="en">(0:47) your favorite red sauce over the bottom of a large baking dish. Line up 3-4 lasagna noodles,</p>
<p lang="en">(0:52) no baked noodles make things easy. Spread over half of the ricotta mixture, add basil leaves,</p>
<p lang="en">(0:58) and then put down a second layer of noodles. Add another cup of sauce and cover with half</p>
<p lang="en">(1:03) of the mozzarella and fontina cheese. Add a third layer of noodles, spread over the rest</p>
<p lang="en">(1:08) of the ricotta mixture, then scatter more basil leaves on top. Add a fourth layer of noodles,</p>
<p lang="en">(1:13) spread one more cup of sauce on top, and finish with the remaining mozzarella and fontina cheeses.</p>
<p lang="en">(1:17) Bake the lasagna uncovered until the cheese bubbles and the noodles cook</p>
<p lang="en">(1:21) about 30 minutes. And that's it! Outrageously cheesy</p>
<p lang="en">(1:26) cheese lasagna that's surprisingly easy to make. We hope you try it!</p>
